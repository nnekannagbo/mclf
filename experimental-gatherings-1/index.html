        <h1>Experimental Gatherings<br><span class="subtitle">Inspiration Show &amp; Tell</span></h1>

        <p>Recently I hosted a tiny experimental gathering. The idea was to gather a small group of people and share creative energy together.</p>

        <p>This gathering was unique because it was: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Unusually short - 1 hour instead of 3</li>
          <li>Unusually small - 8 people instead of 20+</li>
          <li>At home instead of a tech office</li>
          <li>With soup & tea instead of candy & beer</li>
          <li>Sharing inspirations rather than promoting our own creative output </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I’ve been to many events that were long and large with free candy and artists talking about their own work, and sometimes they are incredible. But I’m very curious about experimenting with the fabric of creative gatherings to see what is possible.</p>
        <p class="highlightme">How does experimenting with format change how we relate to each other? Does sharing inspiration sources feel fundamentally different than sharing our own work? How do we connect and co-create in tiny gatherings?</p>

        <h2>Invitation template:</h2>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/cm-clock.png" alt="drawing of a clock" class="image">


        <ul class="noBullet-list">
          <li><strong>What</strong>: A tiny one-hour gathering experiment</li>
          <li><strong>Why:</strong> To share creative inspirations together</li>
          <li><strong>How: </strong>Gather together and share art over soup and tea</li>
          <li><strong>What to bring: </strong>A work of art* that inspires you creatively</li>

           <li>*Wondering if something counts as art?<strong> </strong>The answer is definitely yes.
            Intervention art, machine art, play art, strange tools, weird DIY projects very welcome. The art can be made by anyone, as long as it isn't you.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>How did it go?</h2>

        <p>Well I always deal with ragged and unspooling feelings when organizing any kind of gathering. I loop myself around in a taunting voice while yanking on the tendons that hold me together while shredding my
          foundational sense of self-worth. Then I ruminate for a week or year, waking through the night in horror at something I said or didn't say, did or didn't do. It’s hard to be objective.</p>

        <h2>Okay but how did it go?</h2>

        <p>It was wonderful - a handful of incredible people gathered together for an hour and shared creative inspirations. </p>

        <p>The inspirations were diverse - a totally unique physical <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/203725740-subcutanean"><span>book</span></a>, using <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190719162358/https://growyourown.cloud/"><span>plants</span></a> to store data, a cat <a href="https://mastodon.social/@wikihow?max_id=103785667416671810"><span>bot</span></a>, someone smashing their
          head into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnoSmhBHJvK/"><span>screen</span></a>, a person <a
            href="https://www.tiktok.com/@piercetheloveveil/video/6802711595366632710?u_code=d945mf7h4e4di4&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;timestamp=1583966761&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=android&amp;share_app_name=musically&amp;share_iid=6802827959353001733&amp;source=h5_m"><span>playing</span></a> a

          box electronic <a href="https://vimeo.com/33048071"><span>music</span></a>.   </p>

        <p>I intentionally invited people from different communities so most people knew or knew of some of the others, but no one knew everyone. Everyone met someone new.</p>

        <h2>Timeline:</h2>

        <ul class="noBullet-list">

          <li><strong>5 years ago</strong> - consider doing this.</li>
          <li><strong>2 years ago</strong> - agonize over details (despite knowing that I need to do to know).</li>
          <li><strong>1 year ago</strong> - consider and reconsider how it should work.</li>
          <li><strong>1 week ago</strong> - invite people (no turning back).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Gathering Day!</h4>
        <ul class="noBullet-list">
          <li><strong>10:00</strong> - Start simmering soup broth.</li>
          <li><strong>4:30</strong> - Grocery-shop for a missing ingredient.</li>
          <li><strong>5:05</strong> - Consider <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus"><span>handwashing plan</span></a>. Do I have time to make a funny sign?</li>
          <li><strong>5:08</strong> - Get music playing.</li>
          <li><strong>5:10</strong> - Have a billion new ideas about experimental gatherings. Need to start soup!</li>
          <li><strong>5:11</strong> - Start tea and soup (spiced broth, oven-roasted mushrooms, noodles, Thai basil).</li>
          <li><strong>5:30</strong> - Try to time the food and 3 pots of tea to be ready but not cold at 6.</li>
          <li><strong>5:45</strong> - Someone arrives, distractedly welcome them while pots boil over.</li>
          <li><strong>5:50</strong> - Balance greetings &amp; cooking with mixed success.</li>
          <li><strong>6:00</strong> - More arrivals, people help by greeting each other.</li>
          <li><strong>6:03</strong> - I share the intention of the gathering.</li>
          <li><strong>6:08</strong> - People chat over tea while I set up the soup station.</li>
          <li><strong>6:10</strong> - People get soup. Should we start? Or wait for the last person?</li>
          <li><strong>6:15</strong> - Try to check messages, check breathing. Is the last person locked outside?</li>
          <li><strong>6:17</strong> - We sit down to start. I share the intention again for the new arrivals.</li>
          <li><strong>6:20</strong> - Another person arrives, we pause to loop them into the moment.</li>
          <li><strong>6:23</strong> - I share the intention again.</li>
          <li><strong>6:25</strong> - Introductions - how to make this fun without feeling like an awkward icebreaker.</li>
          <li><strong>6:30</strong> - Begin sharing! I go first to try to set the tone/make it not scary for others.</li>
          <li><strong>6:35</strong> - Everyone takes a turn sharing. Deciding on order is hard and the hdmi cable is short.</li>
          <li><strong>6:40</strong> - We feel out what we are doing together as we go. People are co-supportive.</li>
          <li><strong>6:45</strong> - A timer would be nice.</li>
          <li><strong>6:58</strong> - Frantically making time for the last person.</li>
          <li><strong>7:00</strong> - I let people know the event is over. I want to honour the rule but we want to talk.</li>
          <li><strong>7:02</strong> - We talk about what we enjoyed and what we would change about the gathering.</li>
          <li><strong>7:05</strong> - Horror: we realize that the last person to arrive didn’t share. They share.</li>
          <li><strong>7:10</strong> - The event ends again, people help clean up.</li>
          <li><strong>7:15</strong> - People leave slowly, we want to talk more!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What worked</h2>

        <p>It’s funny how making a list of things “that worked” makes me realize all the things that did work. </p>
        <ul class="noBullet-list">

          <li><strong>Venue</strong> - I live in a large apartment on a metro line so it’s easy to host (hooray Montreal).</li>
          <li><strong>Movement</strong> - People weren't trapped in self-isolation because of a pandemic yet.</li>
          <li><strong>Visuals</strong> - I have a projector, thankfully it wasn’t too light at 6pm.</li>
          <li><strong>Food/drink</strong> - Soup and tea were nourishing.</li>
          <li><strong>Amount</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>people</strong> - 8 people was good. We could do a few more/less if we are mindful of time</li>
          <li><strong>Short meeting time -</strong> There was near-unanimous excitement about restricting it to an hour. Even though we all wanted more time. An hour is very easy to say yes to. It was short enough that people
            could even use their metro transfer to go home.</li>
          <li><strong>Greetings: </strong>Taking a moment to greet each person and actually open to them is so important.</li>
          <li><strong>Handwashing</strong> - Everyone washed their hands on arrival. In our culture asking someone to wash feels very aggressive, but everyone was supportive.</li>
          <li><strong>Setting the intention -</strong> Communicating why we were gathering and what we hoped to do together.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety/Disclosure - </strong>Communicating that I want the gathering to be good for people. Communicating that I would want to change things to make the experience work for people. Also disclosing a personal
            example.</li>
          <li><strong>Guests</strong> - Everyone was curious, kind, and supportive of each other and of the experiment.</li>
          <li><strong>Host going first -</strong> Going first worked well to set the tone and make people feel safe. </li>
          <li><strong>Sharing inspirations</strong> - Sharing creative inspirations in contrast with sharing our own output feels more exploratory, gentle/tentative, and comes out of a wider possibility space. Sharing our own work
            always feels a tiny
            bit like self-promotion under late capitalism, even when it involves critical support and/or glowy feelings of community and validation.</li>
          <li><strong>Getting feedback - </strong>It was really helpful to get feedback from people both immediately at the end of the event and also a day later.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What didn’t work</h2>
        <ul  class=noBullet-list>
          <li><strong>Invitations</strong> - I wrote an invitation template then totally re-wrote each invitation differently for each person (hello anxiety!) I accidentally left out a very important detail on one invitation. Next
            time: copy paste the
            invitation. It’s very hard, but do it.</li>
          <li><strong>Event start time</strong> - This gathering was unique for being very short (1 hour). And people loved it. But it’s not great to feel rushed though arrivals. Next time: add a 15 minutes buffer for arrivals.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cohesive arrival time: </strong>Setting intentions and talking about important safety/comfort stuff needs to be at the beginning. But people arriving after the start time makes it impossible to make sure
            everyone has the same
            information. Next time: I would better communicate the start time.</li>
          <li><strong>Greetings &amp; Food</strong> - Welcoming people is one of the most important parts of organizing a gathering and creating a feeling. I was distracted by boiling-over pots and oven-mushrooms. Next time: make
            easier soup.</li>
          <li><strong>Introductions</strong> - Doing a specific introduction round was nice, but also it felt awkward when I asked this tiny group of people to say more than their names (example: “tell us your name and a delicious
            food/drink you have
            had recently”). Next time: try doing just names.</li>
          <li><strong>Links</strong> - It was difficult to find some of the links on the spot. Next time: gather as many links as possible before the gathering. Saves precious time and also the awkwardness of people trying to use a
            strange computer.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Sharing inspirations -</strong> Many people really wanted to share their own work by the end. I don’t really know if this is a “didn’t work” or a “did work”. I want to mention it here though.</li>
          <li><strong>Audio</strong> - My laptop speakers did not sound excellent. Next time: a better speaker, especially for audio-based creative inspirations.</li>
          <li><strong>Sharing</strong> <strong>time</strong> - We ran out of time and the last people to share had to go fast. One person almost didn’t get to go. Next time: a gentle timer to track each person’s turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Big open questions</h2>
        <ul  class=noBullet-list>

          <li><strong class="highlightme">How do we solve the organizer’s curse?</strong> This is what I call it when I make an event or space because it’s what I want to experience but in the act of making it I don’t really get to experience it.</li>
          <li><strong class="highlightme">What’s a non-invasive way to divide time between people? </strong>How do we set a timer without it feeling aggressive, people-flattening, or institutional? Different people have different needs in different
            moments. Maybe a
            visual timer or gentle tone, with a moderator making value judgements in the moment?</li>
          <li><strong class="highlightme">How to care about something without being anxious about it? </strong>It’s very easy to make something you don’t care about and feel zero anxiety. But the more I care about the guests, the more the content of
            the gathering
            matters to me, the harder I find it to be calm and bring peaceful or joyful energy to the experience.</li>
          <li><strong class="highlightme">How to design for openness, access, and difference while also designing with shared values or cohesiveness? </strong>It’s easy to design a cohesive gathering when the guests are
            curated. But closed communities are inaccessible and stagnant. </li>
          <li><strong class="highlightme">What is the right amount of constraints, and how strictly should we keep them? </strong>I’ve noticed over the last 10 years of organizing gatherings and communities that if there
            are any constraints (example 1:
            this is only one hour) they are always the first thing people want to change. But events without constraints seem to leak energy until they quietly deflate (more: <a href="https://www.priyaparker.com/thebook"><span>Priya
                Parker</span></a>).</li>
          <li><strong class="highlightme">How to provide clear rules around behaviour without killing the magical feeling?</strong> The dream is that somehow people intuit the hard stuff and everyone is feeling together and safe. But I’ve seen a lot
            of organizers avoid
            being explicit in order to prioritize vibes and fall into the<a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm"><span> tyranny of structurelessness</span></a>. </li>
          <li><strong class="highlightme">How to get good feedback: </strong>This was an experimental event, so I am deeply curious about how it felt and what people thought. But I find it difficult to find the right questions to ask. I know a lot
            about
            how <em>not </em>to ask questions, but I haven’t found a magical formula or ruleset to guide my question-asking. </li>
        </ul>

        <p class=quote>Note: This gathering was right before we all started self-isolating because of the pandemic crisis. Future experiments will have to be online.</p>
