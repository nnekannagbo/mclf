        <h1>ComeWithMe<br><span class="subtitle">Changing the spaces between us</span></h1>

        <p>ComeWithMe will be an experimental videogame exploring the connections between people. Building from my
          previous art games (Closer, Common, Follow) on the themes of connection and collaboration, ComeWithMe is an
          invitation for people to playfully connect and engage with each other in the space.</p>
        <p>I’d like to make an experimental multiplayer game at Metalab using live pose. The game will visualize the
          connections between people. Building off of previous projects in this theme (Closer, Follow, and Common)
          ComeWithMe will be a game about how people engage and relate to each other. My previous games relating to
          connection have been unpolished visually. ComeWithMe will be prettier, with hand sculpted 3d visuals like I
          made for Soft Sanctuary.</p>
        <!-- <img src="../img/blog-images/tr-toilet.png" alt="drawing of toilets" class="wide-image image"> -->

        <h2>The Game:</h2>
        <p>ComeWithMe is a multiplayer experimental art game about the spaces and connections between people. ComeWithMe
          is for 2-10 players to play physically (using Live Pose) and is represented on the screen.
        </p>

        <h2>Players</h2>
        <p>Each player is represented by a 3d sculpted shape. Each player is trying to build connections and collect
          objects while avoiding obstacles.

          Players build connections (flowing strands of multicolour rope) by mutually and repeatedly pointing at each
          other over time. Players with more connections become larger.

          The core challenge is that connections are severed if players have not pointed at each other in a specific
          amount of time.
        </p>

        <h2>Environmental Play</h2>
        <p>On the screen, certain 3d elements appear that, when collected, create pleasing visuals and sounds for
          players (or clusters of players). There are other 3d elements which completely sever/burst the connections
          between players, or remove colour from players temporarily.
        </p>

        <h2>Sound</h2>
        <p>The game will have gentle ambient background sounds. Each core action (connections, collisions) will have a
          unique sound. If I have time, I’d like for each player to have a simple progression of notes, their own audio
          avatar. When players connect, those notes will shape together to create a unique melody for the group.
        </p>
