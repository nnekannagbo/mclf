        <h1>Teaching online: <br><span class="subtitle">Challenges, Tactics, and New Possibilities</span></h1>

        <p>Learning online isn’t easy.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get distracted, disconnected and overwhelmed. And then there are the technical problems.</p>
<p>Below I share 5 problems I've noticed when teaching online, and how I work with them. I also list some new advantages and affordances.</p>

<p>I have experience with teaching, online communities, and technology, so I hope I have something useful to share here. </p>

<p>If you have other ideas, I'd love to hear them.</p>

        <h2>5 Challenges Teaching Online</h2>


        <h3>1. Feeling distracted - How can we support people in staying focused?</h3>


        <p>When we sit down to learn at our devices it’s easy to be carried away by the infinite scroll. Especially in times of high stress. And our natural deterrents - energetic human presence, the excitement of sharing physical space, the
          social pressure to pay attention - it's all totally gone.</p>

          <p>Tips to build attention:</p>
        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Anchor everything in purpose:</span> Make space for people to define learning goals and motivations. Why are we here?</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Acknowledge our distraction:</span> Perhaps it makes sense to be distracted right now? Make space for acceptance.
          <li><span class="blue">Work together:</span> Consider together how and why we are distracted and consider together what can we do to help ourselves and each other.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Break it up:</span> Divide, number, and continuously communicate the key steps that lead towards our goal. (“Now we are on step 3/5, how to fold the wings of the paper plane”).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Participatory processing:</span> Make time to process information with spoken words, written words, movement, or drawing.</li>
          <li><span class="blue"><span class="highlightme">Interaction is the antidote to distraction</span>: </span> Play with exercises, “hands up if you think X”, group conversation, chat, breakout rooms, anything else you can dream up. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Invite curiosity:</span> Make space for learners to have questions before discussing answers. Ask questions like: “what do you think will happen if we do this?”</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Invest time in playfulness and joy:</span> channel your own curiousity and enthusiasm. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Feeling disconnected: How to encourage connection with each other online?</h3>

        <p>We are missing physical energy, important biological signaling, and subtle interpersonal feedback when we interact online. Instead, we have awkward pauses, miscommunications, and people accidentally speaking over each other. It’s easy to feel disconnected and alone.</p>

        <p>Tips to build connection:</p>

        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Keep it personal:</span> Welcome people when they arrive by name. Allow people to feel your warmth and the friendly weight of human interaction.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Do a check-in together:</span> Everyone should be heard and everyone should hear the others.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Celebrate the experimental</span> state of online learning. Building something together fosters vulnerability and connection.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Design for connection</span> with low-pressure collaborative exercises.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Schedule time</span> for questions and emergent connection between people.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Co-create structure:</span> Expectations related to behaviour should be created together (The image below is a real sample from a workshop I teach).</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>3. Feeling overwhelmed - How can we support learners while they renegotiate everything?</h3>

        <p>We are all in a drastically new situation. Most of us are facing extreme stress and anxiety about an uncertain future. And now we need to move our lives online. Unfortunately, many of our supports and coping strategies don't translate to the internet. We have to do the strenuous work of re-negotiating and re-adapting everything to meet our needs. </p>
        <p>Tips to help support and ground people:</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Learner first:</span> Respect that learners come with valuable pre-existing knowledge and goals.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Communicate support:</span> Tell learners explicitly that you want to help them meet their own needs in a way that works for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Design for flexibility:</span> Support different learning styles and needs.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Mindful of health:</span> Include regular stretching or time-out breaks in the schedule.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Honor the structure:</span> Begin and end the lesson on time to help everyone manage cognitive and emotional resources.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Patience:</span> Understanding and kindness to ourselves and the people around us. We are adapting to totally new systems while living through a crisis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Feeling Lost - How can we notice lost learners and help them get back</h3>


        <p>There are many ways for people to become lost online. Technology can fail, communication can fail, and people can miss a step or get lost in exploration. Unfortunately, it is also much harder to notice when learners fall away online.</p>
        <p>Shepherding tips:</p>

        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Organize content and check-in:</span> Check-in at each key step to ensure that no-one has missed a step, has a question, or is feeling lost.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Encourage questions:</span> Make sure learners know when and how they can ask their urgent and less urgent questions.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Loop everyone together after any pause or question:</span> Clearly state that you are moving on. Check especially for learners who lost focus in the pause.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Ask for a yes:</span> When checking in, ask for a yes (“hands up if you see this on your screen”) instead of a public admission of failure (“is anyone lost?”)</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Use repetition and reviews</span> to help learners bridge lost moments and reinforce learning.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Follow up</span> after a lesson with a short clear message listing important takeaways or assignments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Tech fails: How do we deal with technology?</h3>

        <p>Everything online is mediated by strange chains of complex technologies. Technology will always eventually break, and it can be extremely stressful and disruptive. </p>
        <p>Tips to avoid and manage tech failures:</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Choose technologies/tools thoughtfully:</span> Every tool and technology will exclude some people. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Test tools before using with learners:</span> Use different computers, phones, tablets, and browsers.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">List common problems and solutions:</span> Take time to list and plan solutions for common problems. Every technical problem our learners have is now also our problem.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Communicate about technology in advance:</span> Ask learners directly for any needs, preferences, and concerns about technology and learning. Check-in to ensure the systems are actually working for learners.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Schedule a buffer period:</span> Take 5-15 minutes on the first day to check everyone's tech: internet (<a target="_blank" href="http://fast.com/">25 megabits/sec min</a>); external power; software updates; microphone and video
            (turn on and off for practice); quiet location.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Decide together on webcams:</span> (on or off). Keeping cameras on drastically improves participation, energy, communication, and accountability. But keeping
            cameras on negatively impacts access for people who don't have webcams or internet bandwidth, can lead to accidental sharing, and can make people feel shy or uncomfortable.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Some tech fails are unavoidable</span> We do our best. Channel humour and patience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="newpossibilitieswhenteachingonline">New possibilities teaching online:</h2>

        <p>Thinking about challenges and barriers is useful. But new platforms also come with new possibilities. We can look to <a href="https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29607/24772">crip</a> communities, MOOCs, and early internet forums, for inspiration and leadership.</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Asynchronous learning:</span> with recorded content, learners can learn at times that work for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Larger audiences:</span> we can easily share with many people instead of few.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">General accessibility:</span> content online can be more accessible for some people.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Reusable content:</span> content can be reused and remixed in creative ways.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Lower barrier to entry:</span> if you are reading this, you could design and teach a workshop right now.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Collaboration and proximity:</span> teachers and learners can be anywhere in the world or time zone.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Cost:</span> lower costs related to location (rent, maintenance, furniture).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Flexible Speed:</span> learners can speed up and slow down recorded content to meet their needs.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Closed captions:</span> closed captions and transcripts are easier to generate.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Language:</span> recorded content is easier to translate and make accessible in other languages</li>
          <li><span class="blue">New hybrid experiments:</span> for example: we can record a series of micro lecture videos to use while teaching: we benefit from quality edited content while having the energy of live interactions.</li>

        </ul>
