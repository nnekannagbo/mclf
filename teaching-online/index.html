        <h1>Teaching online: <br><span class="subtitle">Challenges, tactics, and new possibilities</span></h1>

        <!-- <img src="../img/blog-images/vt-meet.png" alt="Two people trying to reach eachother through a window" class="image"> -->

        <p>People are stuck at home right now feeling lonely, anxious, or bored. By creating positive learning environments we can help people feel excited, inspired, and connected. </p>

        <p>I have experience with online communities, experimental teaching, and technology, so my experience and personal toolkit are useful in tackling barriers inherent to online learning. </p>

        <h2>5 challenges when teaching online</h2>

        <h3>1. Feeling disconnected: How to encourage connection with each other online?</h3>

        <p>We are missing tons of energy, bodily information, and feedback when we interact online. It’s very easy to feel disconnected and fail to build intimacy or community.</p>
        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Keep it personal:</span> Welcome people when they arrive by name. Allow people to feel your warmth and the friendly weight of human interaction.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Do a check-in together:</span> everyone should be heard and everyone should hear the others.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Celebrate the experimental</span> state of online learning. We can build this together!</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Co-create structure:</span> expectations related to behaviour should be created together.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Design for connection</span> with collaborative exercises.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Schedule time</span> for questions and emergent connection between people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Feeling overwhelmed - How can we support learners while they renegotiate everything?</h3>

        <p>When we enter drastically new situations (moving everything online) many of our supports and coping strategies stop working. We have to do the strenuous work of re-negotiating and re-adapting everything to meet our needs. </p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Learner first:</span> learners should be supported in sharing their existing knowledge and setting their own goals.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Communicate support:</span> tell learners explicitly that you want to help them meet their own needs in a way that works for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Design for flexibility:</span> support different learning styles and needs.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Include regular stretching</span> or time-out breaks in the schedule.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Honor the structure:</span> begin and end the lesson on time to help people manage cognitive and emotional resources.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Be patient</span> with yourself and the people around you. We are adapting to totally new systems while living through a crisis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Feeling distracted - How can we support people in staying focused?</h3>


        <p>When we sit down to learn at our devices it’s easy to be carried away by the infinite scroll. Especially in times of high stress. And our natural deterrents - energetic human presence, the excitement of sharing physical space, the
          social pressure - is all totally gone.</p>
        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Anchor everything in purpose:</span> make space for people to define personal learning goals and motivations. Why are we here collectively and individually?</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Acknowledge distraction:</span> attention is challenging, especially now. Work together to consider what makes us distracted, and what can we do to help ourselves and each other.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Break it up:</span> Divide, number, and continuously communicate the key steps that lead towards the goal. (“Now on step 3/5, how to fold the wings of the paper plane”).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Participatory processing:</span> make time for learners to process information with spoken words, written words, drawing, or something else that works for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Interaction is the antidote to distraction: </span> Use exercises, “hands up if you think X”, group conversation, chat, breakout rooms, anything else you can dream up. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Invite curiosity:</span> Make space for learners to have questions before discussing answers. Ask questions to help create gentle urgency: “what do you think will happen if we do this?”</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Invest time in playfulness and joy:</span> channel your own curiousity and enthusiasm. </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>4. Feeling Lost - How can we notice lost learners and help them get back</h3>


        <p>There are many ways for people to become lost online and it is much harder to notice when learners fall away. Technology can fail, communication can fail, and people can miss a step or get lost in exploration.</p>

        <ul class="">

          <li><span class="blue">Organize content and check-in:</span> Check in at each key step to ensure that no-one has missed a step, has a question, or is feeling lost.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Reward questions:</span> Communicate clear action-paths for questions (Let me know if you have an urgent question by speaking out loud. Non-urgent questions can be written in the chat, we’ll address them after each
            step).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Loop everyone together after any pause or question:</span> Clearly state that you are moving on. Check again for lost learners and also check for learners who lost focus in the pause.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Ask for a yes:</span> When checking in, ask for a yes (“hands up if you see this on your screen”) instead of a public admission of failure (“is anyone lost?”)</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Use repetition and reviews</span> to help learners bridge lost moments and reinforce learning.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Follow up</span> after a lesson with a short clear message listing important takeaways or assignments.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>5. Tech fails: How do we deal with technology?</h3>

        <p>Everything online is mediated by a chain of different technologies. Technology breaks, and it’s stressful and disruptive. </p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Choose technologies/tools thoughtfully:</span> Every tool and technology will exclude people. And many online tools have privacy issues.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Test tools with friends:</span> use different computers, phones, tablets, and browsers.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">List common problems and solutions:</span> every technical problem our learners have is now also our problem.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Communicate about technology in advance:</span> ask directly for any needs, preferences, and concerns about technology and learning. Check-in to ensure the systems are actually working for people.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Schedule a buffer period at the beginning of class for learners</span> to complete a tech checklist: internet (25 megabits/sec min [fast.com](http://fast.com/)); external power; software updates; microphone and video
            (turn on and off for practice); quiet location.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Decide together on a strategy for webcams and audio:</span> (on or off). I’ve noticed that keeping cameras on drastically improves participation, maintaining energy, communication, and accountability. But keeping
            cameras can also negatively impact accessibility, can lead to accidental sharing, and can make people feel very shy or uncomfortable. It’s a decision for the group, and also a decision for each person.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Some tech fails are unavoidable</span> For example: someone else in the house accidentally unplugged the router). We’ll get through this with humour and patience.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="newpossibilitieswhenteachingonline">New possibilities teaching online:</h2>

        <p>Thinking about challenges and barriers is useful. But new platforms also come with new possibilities. We can look to <a href="https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29607/24772">crip</a> communities, MOOCs, and early internet forums, for inspiration and leadership.</p>

        <ul class="">
          <li><span class="blue">Asynchronous learning:</span> with recorded content, learners can learn at times that work for them.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Larger audiences:</span> we can easily share with many people instead of few.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">General accessibility:</span> content online can be more accessible for some people.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Reusable content:</span> content can be reused and remixed in creative ways.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Lower barrier to entry:</span> if you are reading this, you could design and teach a workshop right now.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Collaboration and proximity:</span> teachers and students can be anywhere in the world or time zone.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Cost:</span> lower costs related to location (rent, maintenance, furniture).</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Flexible Speed:</span> learners can speed up and slow down recorded content to meet their needs.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Closed captions:</span> closed captions and transcripts are easier to generate.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Language:</span> recorded content is easier to translate and make accessible in other languages</li>
          <li><span class="blue">New hybrid experiments:</span> for example: we can record a series of micro lecture videos to use while teaching: we benefit from quality edited content while having the energy of live interactions.</li>
