TODO
add emily's music
debug the problem that happens when someone changes their mind
add choice animation -  "other choice" fades away and your choice is highlighted
add spacer walls between levels (when Robin delivers them)
ensure it works on mobile - images & layout (need walls with portrait ratio from Robin)
ensure it works on mobile - UX & UI (after item above)
add transitions and animations on all buttons
integrate scroll trigger animations
  1. Temporarily "lock" a background in place while I scroll in animated elements (unlock when I click a button)
  2. Have an animation that starts animating when I click a button, continues animating when I scroll, and finishes animating when I reach another div.
get it to load much faster
nicer looking png images for the logos at the end (need to get from Robin and Rachel)
browser compatibility: works in chrome, firefox, IE
modify text - updates and tweaks!
building a new custom music player with Robin's new gifs (this might be v. hard)
integrating custom "last levels" (with code when Robin finishes them)
integrating the clickable gifs - may be a big project (when Robin sends them in) 

IF TIME
things that follow the cursor?
music player animates - "length of song/where you are in the song"
choose your character
text generation for final screen?
animating waves

QUESTIONS
is it good to have the images in the background?
