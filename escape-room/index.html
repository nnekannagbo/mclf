        <h1>Escaping from here: <br><span class="subtitle">Designing an Escape Room I'd actually want to play</span></h1>

        <p>When I was small I had a fantasy about getting locked in the library overnight. Maybe I didn’t hear the librarian calling? Maybe my parents were thinking about something else while they took my sisters home?</p>
        <p> Suddenly I am alone in the perfect quiet, surrounded by the infinite possibility of thousands of books. The lock in this fantasy isn't locking me in, it is locking the world out.</p> 
        <img src="../img/blog-images/er-books.png" alt="Drawing of myself as a child surrounded by books" class="wide-image">
        <p>I still feel a little tug when I look at certain kinds of bookshelves, libraries, or bookstores. But there's no librarian pushing me out or a parent turning off the lights. The fantasy is dead because the locks are on the inside.</p>
        <h2>Escape Rooms</h2> 
        <p>An escape room is a game where players try to solve puzzles together in a limited amount of time. People are not actually trapped. They are kept in the room by social pressure, pride, or pleasure.</p>
        <p>I did my first escape room in San Francisco. The people I was playing with were exceptionally clever, kind, and delighted.</p>
        <p>But I was not feeling delighted. My mind was resolute: unless these puzzles proved themselves relevant, my brain would not exert itself for them. And from deep inside me, a vehement refusal of the artifical urgency. </p>
        <img src="../img/blog-images/er-gmo.png" alt="Drawing of a person saying get me out of here" class="wide-image">
        <p>Eventually I settled on wandering around in the tiny space, helping with tiny physical tasks, unsucessfuoly trying to accept my difference, and hoping no one would notice.</p> 
        <p>But I kept thinking about the experience. Why did it feel so flat? Am I not trapped? Do I not desire escape?</p>
        <h2>Designing an escape room</h2> 
        <p>After this, I decided to make my own escape room. I had just emerged from burnout, and I needed to be gentle. This would be a project without code, without iteration, without commitment, and without a destination. It would be a one-time
          project with paper, found materials, a safe(r) environment (Gamerella) and very few participants.</p>
        <!-- <img src="../img/blog-images/er-gamerella.png" alt="Gamerella photo" class="wide-image"> -->
        <h2>Confinement</h2>
        <p>Can there be escape without confinement? Human beings do not like to be trapped. Strangely, we do like to fantasize about being trapped. My childhood library fantasy is one example. I have a more recent fantasy, where I find myself powerless to do anything, and am momentarily free from the constant and enormous internal pressure to be choosing or improving or producing.</p> 
        <img src="../img/blog-images/er-tiedup.png" alt="Drawing of a person who is tied up" class="wide-image">

        <p>Pleasurable confinement doesn't really work for an Escape Room though, people will just writhe on the floor sighing with joy. The idea core to my Escape Room would be escape, not confinement.</p> 
        <h2>Why Escape Rooms don’t work for me</h2>
        <p>Why didn’t escape rooms work for me? There are three core problems: arbitrary goals, intense pressure, and alienation. </p>
        <p><strong>Arbitrary Goals: </strong> What if the escape room goals and puzzles had relevance and meaning to our lives? Maybe an escape room inspired by someone leaning in too close at a party and you are rooted, frozen, trapped. Or a nightmare where you die and then wake up the next morning in the same bed, and suddenly realize that there is no escape, that death is the out and also the in door?</p> 
        <p><strong>Intense Pressure: </strong> What if the escape room had no additional external pressure? No time limit? I know that some people need a clock ticking down to feel stimulated, but I am continuously and constantly reminded of the dwindling moments of my one precious
          life. I don’t need a timer. </p>
        <p><strong>Alienation:</strong>  There is no guarantee against alienation. But what if the escape room puzzles were related to the problems that I actually face in this moment? What if it responded to me, to you, to us in our actual needs to escape? What if it felt less
          like a cookie-cutter experience, rigid and meticulously designed, and more like a nebulous cloud, designed with certain properties that activate and take shape around us? </p> 
        <h2>My Escape Room</h2> 
        <p>I would work with the idea of escape, but I would add meaningful, self-directed goals, lack of pressure, and a responsive system that players would actively create. I would keep two traditional components of escape rooms: the physical space of gathering itself, and the act of working with others to solve challenges.</p>
 
        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>A blanket fort tent, cushions, and a low table</li>
          <li>A small thick piece of paper for each player to draw a character</li>
          <li>4 additional small thick pieces of paper for each player to draw challenges</li>
          <li>Beautiful pens and markers for writing and drawing </li>
          <li>A small stack of tactics cards on the table, facedown </li>
          <li>A small shell-box on the table </li>
        </ol> 
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I welcome everyone and I offer tea. I describe traditional escape rooms. I explain how this escape room is different. I describe the purpose of this escape room: we are each trapped in some ways, and together we
          might find ways to escape.</p> 
        <p>This thing only comes to life in the space between us. We each choose how deeply we play, we each decide how this experience continues, and we each decide when this is complete. Breaks, new rules, and mid-game abandonments will be unconditionally supported.</p> 
        <h2>Character design</h2>
        <p>We each name and draw our character on the paper. We place our characters in the box.</p> 
        <img src="../img/blog-images/er-box.png" alt="Drawing of the box" class="wide-image">
        <h2>Define barriers</h2>
        <p>With our characters in the box, we now need to find the contours of the room that is containing them. We take some time to draw or write one of the barriers that is trapping our characters. We can draw from our
          own lives. Does something keep us trapped? Something blocking us from the life we want to live? There are examples on hand in case someone would like to see them. When we are done we put our barriers on our
          own barrier holder. Each player can only see their own.</p> 
          <img src="../img/blog-images/er-holder.png" alt="Drawing of the card holder" class="wide-image">
        <h2>Play</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>One person draws a tactic card, and matches it to any of their barriers, laying both on the table to be seen</li>
          <li>That person uses the tactic card to address their barrier.</li>
          <li>Once the barrier has been addressed, the barrier is removed from the player board</li>
          <li>We continue to the next player</li>
          <li>Once all barriers are discussed, the closing ceremony begins</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: the active player is the one who decides when their barrier has been completed. Other players can help, but only when invited to help.

        <h2>Examples of optional rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If the tactic card doesn’t work for the player, they can draw another</li>
          <li>Players are welcome to introduce new tactic cards, but they should draw/write it out</li>
          <li>Players may decide to make a small mark on each others barriers, a mark of having listened and witnessed this practice</li>
        </ul> 
        <img src="../img/blog-images/er-tactics.png" alt="Photo of the tactics cards" class="wide-image">


        <h2>Closing </h2> 
        <p>At the end of completing the barriers, we actively imagine our liberation from these barriers. We lift our characters out of the box and set them free. </p>
        <p>Finally, I designed this space so people could share barriers and strategies with each other, and maybe feel a little less alone. Please feel free to share any tactics you learned. Please don’t share other people’s barriers unless they
          consent. If you want to leave your barriers behind to inspire others and be documented publicly, you can.</p> 
        <p>But you should take your character with you, as they are free to roam the world. </p>
