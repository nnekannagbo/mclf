        <!-- <img src="../img/blog-images/er-escape.png" alt="Drawing of the dream room" class="wide-image"> -->

        <p>When I was small I had a fantasy about getting locked in the library overnight. Maybe I didn’t hear the librarian calling, maybe they were distracted as they locked the door.</p>
        <p> Suddenly I am alone in the perfect quiet, surrounded by the infinite possibility of thousands of books. I curl up in the cushions and read and read and read. The lock in the fantasy isn't locking me in, it is locking the world out.</p> 
        <p>I still feel a little tug when I look at certain kinds of bookshelves, libraries, or bookstores. But the fantasy is dead. </p>

          <p>The person between myself and the books isn’t a librarian pushing me out or a parent turning off
          the lights. The locks are on the inside now.</p>
 
        <h2>Escape Rooms</h2> 
        <p>I did my first escape room in San Francisco.</p> 
        <p>An escape room is a game where players solve puzzles together in order to meet a goal in a limited amount of time. People are only trapped in the room by social pressure, pride, and the joy of a challenge.</p>
        <p>The escape room I tried was a series of puzzles tied together with a loose narrative. The people I was playing with were exceptionally clever, kind, and excited. <p>Of course I felt the pressure of the timer but somehow also felt an overpowering internal refusal of that urgency. My mind was resolute: unless these puzzles proved themselves relevant, it would not focus.</p>
          <p>Eventually I settled on wandering around in the tiny space, helping with tiny physical tasks, trying to accept my difference, and hoping no one else would notice.</p> 
        <p>But I kept thinking about the experience. Why did it feel so flat? Am I not trapped? Do I not desire escape?</p>
        <h2>Designing an escape room</h2> 
        <p>I decided to make my own escape room, an escape room that I would want to play. My intention was to design entirely selfishly, to make something to align with my own desires. This is not how I normally design. I make
          games to be played by other people, the design process usually involves a lot of external listening. </p>
        <p>I had just pulled myself out of a deep pit of burnout, and I needed to be gentle. This would be a project without screens, without code, without iteration, without commitment, and without a destination. It would be a one-time
          project with paper, found materials, a safe(r) environment (Gamerella) and very few participants.</p>
        <h2>Confinement</h2>
        <p>I started by thinking about confinement. There are kinds of confinement that bring pleasure, of course. My library fantasy is one.</p> 
        <p>And an adult fantasy, where I (somehow) find myself powerless to do anything, and am momentarily free from the constant and enormous internal pressure to be improving or producing or doing.</p> 
        <p>Of course there is pleasure in a fantasy of being trapped. Romance novels understand this completely. Pleasure that oozes delightedly out of the liberation from the tyranny of choice.</p> 
        <p>Pleasurable confinement won’t work here, because it’s not a confinement room, it’s an escape room. It’s not going to be very successful if people just writhe on the floor sighing with joy.</p> 
        <h2>Why escape rooms don’t work for me</h2>
        <p>So what would activate this desire to escape, for me? Why didn’t escape rooms work for me? There are three core problems for me in escape rooms: arbitrary goals, intense pressure, and alienation. </p>
        <h2>Arbitrary Goals</h2> 
        <p>What if the escape room goals and puzzles were less arbitrary? Maybe an escape room inspired by someone leaning in too close at a party and you am rooted, frozen, trapped. Or an escape room inspired by the most horrible of places and
          some fantastical wormholes to escape them? Or a nightmare where you die and then wake up the next morning in the same bed, and suddenly realize that there is no escape, that death is the out and also the in door?</p> 
        <h2>Intense Pressure</h2> 
        <p>What if the escape room had no additional external pressure? No time limit? I know that some people need a clock ticking down to feel stimulated, but I am continuously and constantly reminded of the dwindling moments of my one precious
          life. I don’t need a timer. </p>
        <h2>Feeling alien</h2> 
        <p>There is no guarantee against alienation. But what if the escape room puzzles were related to the problems that I actually face in this moment? What if it responded to me, to you, to us in our actual needs to escape? What if it felt less
          like a cookie-cutter experience, rigid and meticulously designed, and more like a nebulous cloud, designed with certain properties that activate and take shape around us? </p> 
        <h2>Parts of escape rooms that I love</h2>
        <p>The parts of escape rooms I loved were: working with the beautiful idea of escape, working against feeling trapped, being in a physical space together, and working with others to solve challenges.</p> 
        <h2>My Escape Room</h2> 
        <p>The room in a blanket fort style tent, on cushions with a low table in the center. There is a tea service for comfort. There is space for 4 people, and there is privacy. We are making something delicate together and having uncommitted
          observers would tilt the balance.</p> 
        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Each player has a small thick piece of paper to draw a character on </li>
          <li>Each player has 4 small thick pieces of paper to draw their challenges on </li>
          <li>Beautiful pens and markers for writing and drawing </li>
          <li>A small stack of tactics cards on the table, facedown </li>
          <li>A small beautiful shell-box on the table </li>
        </ol> 
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The introduction is short. I welcome everyone. I offer tea. I describe traditional escape rooms. I explain how this escape room is different. I describe the purpose of this escape room: we are each trapped in some ways, and together we
          might find ways to escape.</p> 
        <p>We are playing this game together, and it’s a small group on purpose. I was the designer, but we are the creators. It’s only coming to life here in the space between us. We each choose how this experience continues, how deeply or
          shallowly we play, and when the game is done.</p> 
        <p>If you need to leave at any time, or take a break or need to introduce a new rule to make it feel good for you, you have my complete support</p> 
        <h2>Character design</h2>
        <p>We each name and draw our character on the paper. This could be a representation of yourself, but there are no rules around the character, each person can draw or write anything they want. We place our characters in the box.</p> 
        <h2>Define barriers</h2>
        <p>With our characters in the box, we now need to find the contours of the room that is containing them. We take two minutes (or the time we need) to draw or write one of the barriers that is trapping our characters. We can draw from our
          own lives. Does something keep us trapped? Something blocking us from the life we want to live? We go only as deep as we want. There are examples on hand in case someone would like to see them. When we are done we put our barriers on our
          own barrier holder. Each player can only see their own.</p> 
        <h2>Play</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>We begin with anyone who wants to go first. The player who goes first draws a tactic card, and matches it to any of their barriers, laying both on the table to be seen</li>
          <li>The player uses a tactic card to address their barrier</li>
          <li>Once the barrier has been addressed, the barrier is removed from the player board</li>
          <li>We continue to the next player</li>
          <li>Once all barriers are discussed, the closing begins</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Examples of optional rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If the tactic card doesn’t work for the player, they can draw another</li>
          <li>If a player wants to create a new tactic card, they can, but they should draw/write it out so others can use it too</li>
          <li>Players may decide to make a small mark on the barrier, a mark of having listened and witnessed this practice</li>
          <li>After the first round, players decide if one barrier is enough and the game is complete</li> 
        </ul> 
        <h2>Notes on play</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The player decides when their barrier is complete. Often barriers are not actually solvable, it’s a matter of being heard</li>
          <li>Other players can help in the solving of a barrier, but only if they are asked directly. The player decides when and how much help people can provide</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Closing </h2> 
        <p>At the end of completing the barriers, we close our eyes and actively imagine the liberation from these barriers. We open our eyes and with great intent we lift our characters out of the room. </p>
        <p>Finally, I designed this space so people could share barriers and strategies with each other, and maybe feel a little less alone. Please feel free to share any tactics you learned. Please don’t share other people’s barriers unless they
          consent. If you want to leave your barriers behind to inspire others and be documented publicly, you can.</p> 
        <p>But you should take your character with you, as they are free to roam the world. </p>
