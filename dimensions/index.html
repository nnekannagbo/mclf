        <h1>Dimensions of Online Spaces: <br><span class="subtitle">10 Considerations when choosing or designing online
            spaces</span></h1>

        <p>A year ago when the pandemic pushed us online all the time, I made a <a target="_blank"
            href="https://marieflanagan.com/video-tools/">list </a> of standard video tools for meeting with others
          online.</p>
        <p>Since then, I’ve make a <a target="_blank" href="https://marieflanagan.com/online-hangs/">list</a> of more
          experimental spaces for online hangs, hosted <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEcKO0pgrF9/">meetups</a>
          where we explore online collaborative spaces together, and even shared some of these spaces on national
          morning news
          <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheCurrentCBC/status/1346808197554823168?s=20/">radio.</a>
        </p>

        <p>In this work I’ve noticed some interesting dimensions in spaces for connecting online. These dimensions may
          be useful for people who are designing online spaces. They may also be useful to anyone who is
          considering what kinds of spaces they want to use or join.</p>
        <p> I try to give extreme examples to show the edges of the dimensions, but they are mostly spectrums of
          possibility, rather than binary oppositions.
        </p>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 id="scsp">Scheduled <<<>>> Spontaneous</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Scheduled Spaces</span> are designed for gatherings that happen at specific times. For
            example, a weekly Zoom reading group.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Spontaneous Spaces</span> are designed for unplanned connections, allowing you to show
            up at any time. For example Chatroulette (not safe for work) where you can hop on and connect with strangers
            any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Event organizers often prefer to schedule gatherings so they can navigate availability, more tightly manage
          attendees, and handle security problems. Scheduling can be useful for participants as well, building
          consistency, intimate community, and feelings of anticipation.</p>
        <p>Desire is growing for online spaces that resemble offline spaces (pubs, swimming pools, arcades, libraries)
          in flexibly meeting peoples real-time needs and desires. Many attendees often want to manage their social
          energy in real-time, deciding moment-to-moment what they have the energy and capacity to do.</p>

        <h3 id="syas">Synchronous <<<>>> Asynchronous</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Synchronous Spaces</span> require people to be online at the same time. They might be
            spontaneous and they might be scheduled, but they are always real-time, or as close to real time as the
            technology and the human brain allows. For example, Google Meet or any other video meeting.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Asynchronous Spaces</span> allow people to engage at their own convenience. A good
            example is: twitter, or long email exchanges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Synchronous spaces can be great for generating social energy, making space for dynamic connections, and rapid
          feedback. Asynchronous spaces are more like the online version of writing letters, allowing more time for
          processing information or careful consideration.</p>

        <h3 id="tepe">Temporary <<<>>> Permanent</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Temporary Spaces</span> remove content from view after a certain amount of time. A
            popular example is SnapChat. Some platforms are even self-deleting, deleting the “room” or “document” after
            a period of inactivity, like HackPad.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Permanent Spaces</span> keep content up forever. An example of this is a message board,
            where posts can live on as long as someone pays the server fees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Permanent spaces can help people share and transfer knowledge across generations and social bubbles. This can
          be useful, like a message board around a specific illness allowing people to surface shared experience and
          share tactics across decades. Temporary spaces are increasingly popular as they can help ease anxiety around
          the temporal relevance of content.</p>

        <h3 id="cededi">Centralized <<<>>> Decentralized <<<>>> Distributed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Centralized Spaces</span> are organized so everyone is connected to a central hub or
            owner.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Decentralized Spaces</span> are spaces with multiple central hubs or owners.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Distributed Spaces</span> are organized so everyone is able to share ownership of the
            space.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One way to think about this dimension is in terms of the actual servers that host the space. Another way to
          think about it is in terms of the organization of the space itself.</p>

        <h3 id="pucppr">Public <<<>>> Community <<<>>> Private</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Public Spaces</span> are designed for connections between strangers. A good example is
            Dialup, an app that matches you with a random stranger over the phone to discuss a specific topic. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Community Spaces</span> are designed to connect you with a broader community. One
            example might be a Discord group around a specific festival or topic. Another example is the way
            conversations on Twitter or Facebook include the friends of your friends. </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Private Spaces</span> are designed specifically for connection with friends, family,
            and intimate connection. Example of this might be a Signal group chat, or the friends-only social network,
            Cocoon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Public spaces are probably the riskiest spaces, but they can also be the most exciting. Community spaces
          often allow for the adventure of connecting with strangers, with the safety rail of a shared contact or shared
          community. Private spaces are ooo.</p>

        <h3 id="spfl">Spatial <<<>>> Flat</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Spatial Spaces</span> use the space between your avatar and the avatars of other people
            as a meaningful input. They often have “rooms” or “maps”. For example, there are a number of spaces online
            that have spatial audio, so you can only hear and/or see people that you are close to.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Flat Spaces</span> treat all participants identically. A good example is when you see
            every participant in a video call in identical boxes, and hear all participants equally, like Skype.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="tevovi">Text-Only <<<>>> Voice-first <<<>>> Video</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Text-Only Spaces</span> are designed to be used only with written text.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Voice-first Spaces</span> allow people to communicate using their voices. An example is
            Cozy Room, an online gathering space where you are represented by a little character and you see their mouth
            moving as you speak.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Video Spaces</span> allow you to see others and be seen. Some spaces might only allow
            others to see you, like Twitch or YouTube. Some spaces might allow everyone to see everyone, like any video
            call. The far extreme of video connection would be a body-rigged live-cam VR hangout. These spaces allow
            people to communicate with their bodies in a way that feels the most natural to many people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Text-only spaces often have a lower environmental impact and less accessibility issues. Some people find it
          easier to communicate over text than over video for a number of different reasons. Video spaces allow people
          to communicate with their bodies in a way that feels the most natural to many people.</p>

        <h3 id="moun">Moderated <<<>>> Unmoderated</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Structured Spaces</span> have a set of rules that are enforced by special users. If you
            break the rules you are penalized or kicked out. Some spaces are community moderated, where anyone is able
            to kick anyone out, or users are kicked out by vote. For example, that drawing game where you vote to remove
            someone.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Sandbox Spaces</span> have no rules. Of course, all spaces have unspoken rules and
            power structures, so unmoderated spaces can be understood as secretly moderated spaces (Tyranny of
            structurelessness). Unmoderated spaces can be useful when you are curious about the state of the community,
            they communicate a lot about who is present.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="susa">Structured <<<>>> Sandbox</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Structured Spaces</span> have strict or pre-designed structure with very little
            creative freedom.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Sandbox Spaces</span> are created as you go, sometimes offering creative tools but
            mostly relying on participants to create meaning. A good example is minecraft.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="amdi">Ambient <<<>>> Direct</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Ambient Spaces</span> are spaces where you spend a lot of passive time without
            connecting with others. An example is a co-working Discord channel, or a Zoom call with the sound muted.
          </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Direct Spaces</span> are spaces that require full attention and interaction with
            others. An example is a one-on-one video meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ambient spaces can provide feelings of connection and community without asking much of participants. Like
          spontaneous spaces, they allow for more flexibility and responsiveness to meet the needs of people. Direct
          spaces are better for focussed connection between smaller groups, and are nearly always also designed for
          scheduled gatherings.</p>

        <h3 id="cuop">Curated <<<>>> Open</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Curated Spaces</span> only allow for certain kinds of content. Usually there are single
            figureheads or tight groups of people who define and decide what is welcome in the space. These spaces tend
            to foster passionate communities.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Open Spaces</span> are open to any kind of content you want to throw at them. Because
            of the lack of cohesiveness, they often have many people coming and going.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="usre">Used-As-Intended <<<>>> Repurposed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Used-As-Intended Spaces</span> are used more or less for their designed purpose. Of
            course, design often shifts with use, so this is a bit flexible. A good example is Twitter: designed for
            microblogging, and used more or less for this purpose.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Repurposed Spaces</span> are spaces designed for a specific use that are repurposed for
            other kinds of use. A good example of this is Google Spreadsheet Parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="acin">Accessibled <<<>>> Inaccessible</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Accessible Spaces</span> are spaces that people can access. Of course, there is no
            space that all people can access, so like all the other dimensions, this is a spectrum. More accessible
            spaces might take into account features like captions, read-aloud text, support for different languages,
            platforms that work with low-internet, simple and no-flashing visuals, flexibility around camera use, and
            space for people to show up as they are and be welcomed.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Inaccessible Spaces</span> are spaces that block access. Often this involves expecting
            people to use the platform in a rigid way, making no allowances for differences in experiences and
            environments. Questions around inaccessibility might start with: who has access? Who doesn’t have access?
            Who has partial access? Why?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="coco">Collaborative <<<>>> Competitive</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Collaborative Spaces</span> are designed for many people to contribute, often in
            interactive and cumulative ways. Examples include fanfic communities or collaborative whiteboards for online
            drawing.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Competitive Spaces</span> encourage competition by design. For example, most online
            games are competitive spaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="hude">Humanizing <<<>>> Dehumanizing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Humanizing Spaces</span> flatten people into “other” or simple representations.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Dehumanizing Spaces</span> invite complexity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="anpe">Anonymous <<<>>> Persistent Identity <<<>>> Video</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Anonymous Spaces</span> allow you to participate without identifying yourself to other
            participants (you are never completely anonymous online). For example, an online text editor that allows you
            to collaboratively write a story with friends without knowing who wrote which part. Anonymous spaces can be
            enormously liberating, especially if you feel pressure to behave in a certain way.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Persistent Identity Spaces</span> are on the other end of the spectrum, forcing you to
            verify and publish your username with a passport. Sometimes this is necessary for legal reasons. They often
            exclude people who don’t have documentation or have a different name than the documentation.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Onymous Spaces</span> allow you to create a name of your choice, but encourage you to
            use only that name, designing for a singular persistent identity. Persistent usernames can increase
            accountability and allow for richer relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="prpr">Privacy-violating <<<>>> Privacy-first</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Privacy-violating</span> generally exist to collect and sell your data and social
            graphs to advertisers. An excellent example of this is Facebook. This is worth mentioning because it’s often
            the financial model of connecting spaces.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Privacy-first</span> only collect data with your informed consent, and only uses this
            to make the experience better for you. For example, inviting you to share your location to match you with
            other local stamp collectors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="crco">Creation <<<>>> Consumption</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Creation Spaces</span> inherently invite you to actively contribute creatively to the
            space. This might be drawing, music, dance, writing, or even creating the environment.</li>
          <li><span class="blue">Consumption Spaces</span>, in the most absolute sense, don’t belong on this list,
            because they aren’t really spaces for connecting with other people online. But many spaces invite you to
            consume more than create while simultaneously allowing for interactivity. An example for this is a Twitch
            Stream or a Netflix party.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OOO</p>

        <h3 id="coal">Connecting <<<>>> Alienating</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="blue">Connecting Spaces</span> are </li>
          <li><span class="blue">Alienating Spaces</span> are </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Obviously no one wants to make an alienating space for connecting online. But many people do.</p>

        <h3>Last Thoughts</h3>
        <p>There have been platforms for connecting online since the beginning of the internet. The internet itself is a
          platform for connecting. But since the first wave of COVID we’ve seen a massive emergence of online spaces and
          experimentation with how people connect online. It’s strange that the social media giants didn’t leap into
          this opportunity and shoulder everyone else out of the way. They are perfectly positioned, and already have
          hooks in most of us. But I’m delighted that they didn’t.</p>
        <p>Lately I’ve been thinking about how these different platforms vary. About how online spaces shape our
          connections, and how we might reimagine what online spaces could be. </p>
        <p>Now I’m done here I’m going to the park.</p>
