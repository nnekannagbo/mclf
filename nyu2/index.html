        <h1>The Game Center: <br><span class="subtitle">Two weeks - bugs and art?</span></h1>

        <p> It&rsquo;s been two weeks. I&rsquo;ll write about the work below, but first I want to tell you about a feeling I&rsquo;m still having. </p>

        <p>The time has come for some truths to come out. Like I&rsquo;ve been swallowing these vile maggot egg truths for years and I thought my guts disintegrated them but actually they were incubating down there. They are all squirming up all the time
          now and it&rsquo;s a strange feeling. I feel bigger, stronger, and totally different. Like the fog is coming down and a million bugs are flying out of my mouth into the light and I am surviving.</p>

          <img src="../img/blog-images/dr-planb.png" alt="Tea Ceremony in Kharkiv Club" class="wide-image">


        <p>So that&rsquo;s something.</p>

        <p>Anyway. The very first day I got here I drew this on the whiteboard.</p>

        <p> It was a roadmap, or maybe a brain dump? I like dumps, so let&rsquo;s call it a dump. </p>

        <p>I have to finish a project for a public exhibition in 5 weeks. When I think about it I stop breathing for a second. </p>

        <p>It's hard pulling something from inside the self into the outside world. I have to choose between making the thing that speaks truth to me and making the thing that is even slightly coherent outside the ecosystems of my private mind. The process
          of externalizing art feels like a series of compromises until the work itself is unrecognizable. Like a translation of a translation of a translation. Like I ruined it. </p>

        <p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m still not sure how I feel about being chosen, about being an acceptable voice.</p>

        <p>I mean of course I want to be chosen, to be seen. It's been a lifetime of eyes and ears brushing past mine toward something shinier as I clumsily mutter some inarticulate expression of a truth. Can you imagine one human being catching the exact
          same thread that I'm holding? Maybe turning towards my work with a curious smile? </p>

        <p>But does any of this even count when we pluck the work from its context, from privilege and sweat and hunger? When some things are elevated and others are...not? When we put the work in a room and say: here is a thing. Look at this thing, don&rsquo;t
          look at all the mess under the table and in the streets?</p>

        <p>The NYU building is under construction. The construction worker who just walked by said &ldquo;This here is some bulllllll-shit!&rdquo; If my day had a hero, it would be him.</p>

        <p>So, perfect! Back to the dump.</p>

        <p>One of the ideas I&rsquo;m exploring is this idea of opposition. Maybe it&rsquo;s opposition with an enemy. Maybe it&rsquo;s just opposition with your own shadow self. But either way, it&rsquo;s this oppositional movement where you choose one
          thing, and so I choose the other. And our choice is this beautiful splitting apart, and our opposition is this perfect symmetry. Like we are dancing together. Like we are reflections of each other. I&rsquo;d love to somehow create a moment where
          I made that visible, where I create the opportunity for people to *feel* that truth.</p>

        <p>And I have this other idea which is just all about creating a space for people to define their own play. Almost every child is a play designer. Sure, children consume play experiences, but they also invent play experiences. So why, as adults,
          do we only consume? What would play look like if we took a moment to stop and think about the incredibly rich diversity of experiences we have that make us feel playful or open or alive? And then to make space for that? I&rsquo;m imagining a
          tent, and I&rsquo;m inside, and I invite people to design and play something strange and magical and we experience that together.</p>

        <p>And a final idea comes out of the exhaustion I feel even thinking about the party exhibition environment. I'm grateful for every chance I&rsquo;ve had to show my work but also it&rsquo;s hell. </p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s this space which prioritizes the loud, the wild, the wasted. Subtlety is lost. It&rsquo;s raucous, it&rsquo;s overstimulating, people get drunk and their nasties come out. People grab my body, people say hurtful things, people unload
          their fever-fun like a torrent of vomit all over everything. </p>

        <p>I was talking to Ida about making a game that only appears when the room is silent. I was imagining people gently shhhing each other and then there being a moment of soft and quiet in the middle of the mess. If it became impossible to play that
          would be interesting too.</p>

        <p>I have a hundred other ideas. I oscillate between deeply loving each of them and feeling waves of shame when I imagine how they might come out of me. And the faces turning away! Please wish me strength in remembering that some of the people I
          am seeking approval from will never approve of me as I am. </p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve prototyped the first one. Maybe I&rsquo;m FINALLY starting to understand the basics of JavaScript) and I&rsquo;m realizing how hard it is to fluidly communicate anti-mimicry as a mechanic. Help?</p>

        <p>Of course there are snags. I&rsquo;m certain that I don&rsquo;t deserve to be here and that if I communicate this feeling everyone else will realize that I don&rsquo;t deserve to be here. And a giant flying cockroach FLEW into my bedroom and almost
          got tangled in my hair one night, then it hid somewhere inside the bed and thankfully didn't crawl in my ear as I slept. I had New York City price tag shock when I ate dinner out one night and so I'm eating cheap frozen meals. I hurt my neck
          (twice) and was immobilized for days with a heating pad. I went to a coding meet-up in the public library and then got an uncomfortable sexualizing message from a man. And there&rsquo;s the stuff that&rsquo;s been communicated on the internet
          and all the heavy stuff it pulls up from my own past. And finally there&rsquo;s a gnawing fear that I won&rsquo;t make the most of this experience, fear that I&rsquo;ll wake up and it will be over. </p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this residency as an experience. Everyone has been overwhelmingly welcoming and kind to me here. And it&rsquo;s this huge possibility space. So I&rsquo;ve been thinking: what kind of mischief could I get up
          to? Surely I won&rsquo;t spend my invaluable time here doing javascript tutorials and studying logic? How do I invite people to come to me with their collaborative strange ideas for playful interventions? How do I choose to reside in this residence?
          </p>

        <p>More about this next time.</p>
