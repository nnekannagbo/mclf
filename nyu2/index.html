        <h1>The Game Center: <br><span class="subtitle">Two weeks - bugs and art?</span></h1>

        <p>I've been the artist in residence at <a target="_blank" href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/"> NYU's Game Center</a> for two weeks now. I&rsquo;ll write about the work below, but first I want to tell you about a feeling I&rsquo;m having. </p>

        <p>I feel like there are some truths coming out. Like I&rsquo;ve been swallowing these tiny truth eggs for years and I thought my guts disintegrated them but actually they were incubating down there. They are all squirming up all the time now and
          it&rsquo;s a strange feeling. I feel bigger, stronger, and totally different. Like the fog is coming down and a million bugs are flying out of my mouth into the light.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-bugs.png" alt="Drawing of bugs coming out of a person's mouth" class="wide-image">

        <p>So that&rsquo;s something.</p>

        <p>Anyway. The very first day I got here I drew this on the whiteboard.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-whiteboard1.png" alt="Photo of a messy whiteboard" class="wide-image">


        <p> It was a roadmap. Or maybe a brain dump? I like dumps, so let&rsquo;s call it a dump. </p>

        <p>I have to finish a project for the No Quarter exhibition in 5 weeks. The anxiety is relentless. If I pretend the anxiety is excitement it will feel better, right?</p>

        <p>Most of making art is work. It's coding tutorials and circling around ideas and trying to gently pry something living out of the magic place and transplant it into an IKEA. The
          process of externalizing art feels like a series of compromises until the art itself is unrecognizable. Like a translation of a translation of a translation. </p>

        <p>And I&rsquo;m still not sure how I feel about being chosen. I mean of <em>course</em> I want to be chosen, to be seen. To frantically mutter and hold up my precious garbage-art for you. Can you imagine one human being catching the exact same thread that I'm holding? Maybe we even turn towards each other and our faces fall off and our insides bloom out? </p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-one.png" alt="Drawing of two people coming together" class="wide-image">

        <p>That would be delicious. But meanwhile, I tear the work from its context, from the sweat and communities that shape it. I put the work in a frame and say: <em>here</em> is a thing. Look at this thing. Ignore the people under the table debugging code and
          eating frozen-dinners on stolen land.</p>

        <p>The NYU building is under construction. The construction worker who just walked by said &ldquo;This here is some bulllllll-shit!&rdquo; If my day had a hero, it would be him.</p>

        <p>Back to the dump.</p>

        <p>One of the ideas I&rsquo;m exploring is this idea of opposition. Maybe it&rsquo;s opposition with an enemy. Maybe it&rsquo;s just opposition with your own shadow self. But either way, it&rsquo;s this oppositional movement where you choose one
          thing, and so I choose the other. And our choice is this beautiful splitting apart, and our opposition is this perfect symmetry. Like we are dancing together. Like we are reflections of each other. I&rsquo;d love to somehow create a moment where
          I made that visible, where I create the opportunity for people to *feel* that truth.</p>

         <p>I&rsquo;ve prototyped this one. I&rsquo;m realizing how hard it is to fluidly communicate anti-mimicry as a mechanic.</p>


        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-follow.png" alt="Drawing of two fuzzballs moving apart" class="wide-image">


        <p>And I have another idea which is just all about creating a space for people to define their own play. Almost every child is a play designer. Sure, children consume play experiences, but they also invent play experiences. So why, as adults,
          do we only consume? What would play look like if we took a moment to stop and think about the incredibly rich diversity of experiences we have that make us feel playful or open or alive? And then to make space for that? I&rsquo;m imagining a
          tent, and I&rsquo;m inside, and I invite people to design and play something strange and magical and we experience that together.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-tent.png" alt="Drawing of two people in a tent" class="wide-image">

        <p>And a final idea comes out the party exhibition environment itself. I'm grateful for every chance I&rsquo;ve had to show my work, but also it&rsquo;s hell. Game exhibitions prioritize the loud, the wild. Subtlety is lost. It&rsquo;s raucous, it&rsquo;s overstimulating, people get drunk and people unload
          their fever-fun like a torrent of vomit all over everything. So I was thinking about a game that only comes to life when the room is silent. People gently shhhing each other and then there being a moment of soft and quiet in the middle of the playful chaos.</p>


        <p>I have a hundred other ideas. I oscillate between deeply loving each of them and feeling waves of shame when I imagine how they might come out of me. And how they might seem. Let me remember that some people will never approve of me, so long as I am what I am. Chasing that love is like boiling an empty kettle. </p>

        <p>Of course there are other snags. I&rsquo;m certain that I don&rsquo;t deserve to be here. I hurt my neck
          (twice) and was immobilized for days. A giant flying cockroach FLEW into my bedroom one night and then it hid somewhere inside my bed. I can't afford this city so I'm eating frozen meals. I went to a fun coding meet-up in the public library and then received an inappropriate message from a code dude. And finally there&rsquo;s a gnawing fear that I won&rsquo;t make the most of this experience, fear that I&rsquo;ll wake up and it will be over.</p>

        <p>But then there are the people here, who have been so kind to me. People talk to me, they listen to me. They invite me places, teach me things, are open to teachings from me. They buy me burritos, they help me with the terror of my visa application, bring me presents, share vunerabilities, generously give their time, and laugh at my bad jokes. </p>
        <p>When the people part works, the rest will follow</p>
