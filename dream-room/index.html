        <h1>Dream Room: <br><span class="subtitle">Designing for peaceful feelings</span></h1>

        <p>Three years ago I went to Plan B, a new activist festival in Kharkiv, Ukraine. It was held in an old circus: majestic, gilded, and peeling apart at the edges. Everything felt urgent and raw and exciting. There were so many faces and smells and lights and so much noise. </p>
        <p>By the end, I was <strong>exhausted.</strong></p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/dr-planb.png" alt="Tea Ceremony in Kharkiv Club" class="wide-image">

        <p>The closing party was in a subterranean club. You could hear the urgent techno from the door.</p>
        <p>Inside, relentless strobe-lit bodies pounding the ground. The air was wet with energy. Sweaty dancers were thrashing, pulsing, and flailing. </p>
        <p>But in the top corner of the club, a single table. Dreamy candle-lit faces encircling the table. And the host gently pouring each person some tea.</p>
        <img src="../img/blog-images/dr-tea.png" alt="Tea Ceremony in Kharkiv Club" class="wide-image">

        <p>It was perfect. It was a different kind of space inside the space. It was a space to find peace without retreat.</p>
        <p>That's when I knew I would build spaces like this: spaces designed for peace inside the party.</p>


        <h2>Design: The Dream Room</h2>

        <p>I designed and conceived of the dream room collaboratively with Brie Code and Linsey Reymakers. We launched it at A MAZE. Berlin.</p>

				<p>An overview of a space we designed for A MAZE. Berlin</p>
				<h2>What is the Dream Room?</h2>
				<p>The Dream Room is a warm, soft parallel to the party and magical chaos of A MAZE. It is a secret space that you can slip away into, a space that is part of the party--but so much softer.</p>
				<p>The Dream Room is a space with soft music, soft lights, soft surfaces, and warm tea. It is a ritual space for people to connect, and to reflect on the happenings at A MAZE. and the spaces between them.</p>
        <p>Soft cushions, sheer curtains and heated blankets surround an interactive, slowed-down, softened live-feed video projection of some of the (otherwise hectic) hotspots of A MAZE. At the centre of the space is a tea service with an ongoing tea ritual.</p>
				<img src="../img/blog-images/dr-sticker.png" alt="Sticker Design" class="image">

				<h2>Why Does A MAZE. need a Dream Room?</h2>
				<p>All of us need to take a breath from time to time. Even the wildest party friend eventually needs a retreat from the flashing LEDs, moshing friends, and chiptune orchestras. </p>
				<p>And our dreamers and thinkers and softies and quiet weirdos need a space to unfurl, to daydream, and experience A MAZE. in their own way. The Dream Room is a party for the gentlest partiers. It’s a way for people to stay at A MAZE., to be part of A MAZE., but to take some soft time for themselves.</p>
				<p>The Dream Room allows anyone to slip through a secret doorway into a softer party, and to emerge again with replenished energy.</p>

        <h2>The Team</h2>
				<p>We all are personally invested in building softer spaces for care and contempation</p>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The chill-out sanctuary, a lost staple of 90s parties. Or the humble “rest area”, a concept developed by forward-thinking accessibility teams at music festivals.</p>

				<h2>Tech Details/Logistics</h2>


				<p>We need to listen responsively, opening ourselves to a variety of listening tactics: stories, metaphors, images, play, data, interviews, and on-site interactions. Experiential truth is something that needs to be experienced to take shape. </p>
				<p>We must be consent-driven in our practice, continuously open to our unexamined bias, deeply skeptical of all speculative empathy, and diligent in our validation. </p>
				<p>A few questions to consider:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We will need power and heat. The steady and constant warmth of the space is absolutely critical to the concept. Space heaters and blankets should work.</li>
					<li>We will need to mount a projector up high.</li>
					<li>The tent should fit at least 8 people stretched out and lounging in a circular shape. The seating should encourage lounging.</li>
					<li>The installation will be a simple, slowed down, distorted live-feed of A MAZE. hotspots (dance floor, exhibition, talks). Time permitting, there will be an interactive element, a peaceful participatory local multiplayer that is very simple (e.g. drawing digital fish and releasing them into the tea pond).</li>
				</ul>
