        <h1>Leaving The Game Center: <br><span class="subtitle">Closing thoughts</span></h1>

        <p>I’ve completed my Artist Residency at the NYU Game Center. It was a dream opportunity. I was paid money to make art in New York City.</p>
        <p>As a resident, my work was a braid of building practice, connecting with people, and producing works. </p>

        <h2>Product & Process</h2>

        <p>I’m resisting here the pressure to construct and reduce this experience into a list of achievements and products.</p>
        <p>I'm resisting the legend that if I only package the work properly, if only I hustle the work in the right way, if only I talk at enough conferences and shake the right hands while
          saying the right words I'll finally find a way to be seen, to open those doors, to have the resources I need to thrive.</p>
        <p>This legend is harmful. The legend pushes us to notice, produce, and value only things that are easy to measure and label.</p>

        <p>Self: Take time to carefully hold being-in-practice and being-in-relation before grasping at achievements.</p>

        <h2>What I did as Artist in Residence</h2>

        <p>I think about the work I did as a braid of practice, people, and products. Like a braid, these aren't separate items, they come from the same place and are inextricable from each other. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practice (forming/shaping context and work):</strong> Wandering, tuning ideas, fiddling with materials, being present, playing with tools (CNC Mill, laser cutter, fabrication, electronics, javascript),
            auditing classes (like Intro to Game Design with Eric Zimmerman or Joy and Games with Jane Friedhoff), visiting
            spaces & places (like Babycastles, La MaMa, libraries, EyeBeam, SFPC, ITP, parks, ferries). </li>
          <li><strong>People (community/relations): </strong>Being around people (faculty, students, people in the city). Connecting people and being connected. Navigating conflict, alienation, coordination. Becoming attached in the slow way that
            requires proximity and time.</li>
          <li><strong>Products (touchable things): </strong>Making a commissioned work for the No Quarter Exhibition ("Follow"). Creating joyful collaborative projects including "Arcade Friend" and "Tiny Dance Closet". Designing and performing
            "Emergency Exhibition Care". Working on a keycard project: make education accessible to all. Giving talks: an artist
            talk at
            the NYU Game Center, the first ever ITP/IMA Games Club, WWC NYC. Giving feedback on student work, guest teaching Intro to Game Design, hosting a tiny workshop on stress, hosting office hours, and doing individual mentorship. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Being a resident</h2>

        <p>Being a resident is a gift. It's also a strange space to occupy. While being a resident, I thought and worked through what it meant to be a resident. I did intentional work around residency as an occupation. I spent time working through
          the marvelous positioning of being an outsider invited in. </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>The residency can be understood in three parts</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Part 1: An 8-week hustle to conceptualize, design, and code a brand new commissioned game for No Quarter (while navigating some major life changes and relocating to New York City).</li>
          <li>Part 2: Preparing for my big NYU Game Center talk (while dealing with sudden housing instability and trying to physically recover from the consequences of crunch).</li>
          <li>Part 3: A life-changing magical free time of collaboration, shaping work and thriving. (The part I will carry with me for the rest of my life).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning about formal games</h2>
        <p> I learned a lot about games. While studying the formal structure of traditional games I finally clarified some of the things I love about play, and also what I don’t like about games.</p>
        <p>For example: I am completely uninterested in using emotional manipulation to evoke scarcity-based fear or competition, then pushing players to embody or enact stress-motivated relational behaviours. This is no fun for me and I’m totally
          bewildered
          that this is fun for anyone.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Health: I had some major health challenges along the way, including a neck injury that got so bad I had to spend hours laying on the floor of my office.</li>
          <li>Money: This was a well-paying job. But New York is expensive. And unexpected housing precarity in combination with health-related needs made the situation challenging. </li>
          <li>Housing: I had more than one incident related to housing. I won't go into details, but it was traumatic, expensive, and all-around awful. </li>
          <li>Connection: I was very shy to invite myself into people's busy lives. Relationships and community take time, and I didn't have time. I had to rally all my courage and be constantly vulnerable. </li>
          <li>Asking for help: Why is it so scary to ask for help? I found it very challenging to even find the right person to ask for help (code, design, moving, everything!) let alone know what to ask or how to ask.</li>
          <li>Time: There was SO MUCH to do all the time. I felt like each minute was full of possibility and the weather was always perfect and the work was always waiting and the time kept shrinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Regrets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I regret doing the No Quarter commission during the residency. I'm not sure where I would have found the time to do it sooner, but building a new game in 8 weeks is pretty hellish and consumed way too much time and energy.</li>
          <li>Starting office hours late in the residency. I didn't start my office hours until after the No Quarter show (for obvious reasons) but I really loved them and they helped with connection, community, and finding my place.</li>
          <li>Sitting in on classes late in the residency. Again, lack of time made everything hard, but when I audited classed and played student work I felt connected and inspired. It would have been great to do this earlier.</li>
          <li>Inviting people for lunch late in the residency. I ran out of lunches!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If I were staying longer...?</h2>
        <p>For me this is the most interesting question. These are the thing that moved me the most, these are the parts I felt were still unfolding as my Visa ended and I had to leave.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Little experiments and playful interventions: these were absolutely the best part for me. When I was making these experiments I felt I was embodying what an artist-in-residence <em>could</em> be.</li>
          <li>Skill Sharing: For example, I noticed that interpersonal relations and people asserting needs clearly and early (and listening to the needs of others) was a desperately needed skill for many people. I did individual mentoring, but I
            would have liked to formally share my learned abilities around these skills. </li>
          <li>More collaborations: my favourite experiments and interventions were collaborative. When I was working with people (faculty, staff, students, outside community) on weird little projects I felt like we were building these live wires
            between us, creating the work and the context for the work all at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>When I was leaving I called a little meeting to review the experience. It was an in-person presentation of the content above. Below are few comments from people who attended. Everyone agreed that the talk should have been earlier in the
          residency. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>N: I loved the questions you sent before the residency. You sent these questions to us asking “what would a successful residency look like?” and these other questions about what we value and need and it shaped the conversation and the
            entire experience in a new way.</li>

          <li>D: Everyone here knew of you and about you because of these little special things you did. I loved the interventions for the showcase, Arcade Friend, the Dance Closet,
            the workshops you hosted. The big things were great too, but it was the little things that were most special for me.</li>
          <li>D: You are a model artist in residence. I loved when you came to speak at survival skills, and I LOVED your talk. It would make sense to do the talk earlier, now everyone wants to talk to you even more but you are leaving.</li>
          <li>C: This residency needs to be longer!</li>
          <li>F: You were an ideal artist in residence. I understand what artists in residence can do now in a way I didn’t get before. You have raised the bar on what we are able to imagine. </li>
        </ul>
