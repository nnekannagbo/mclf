        <h1>Leaving The Game Center: <br><span class="subtitle">Closing thoughts</span></h1>

        <p>I’ve finished my Artist Residency at the NYU Game Center. I still can't believe that it happened: I was paid to make art in New York City with incredible people.</p>
        <p>As a resident, my work was a braid of building practice, connecting with people, and producing work. </p>

        <h2>Product & Process</h2>

        <p>I’m resisting the pressure to reduce this experience into a list of achievements and products.</p>
        <p>I'm resisting the quiet pressure to notice, produce, and value only things that are easy to label and measure.
        <p>That if I only push myself to the front, present the work with enough hyperbole and ribbons, and shake the right hands while
          saying the right words I'll finally find a way to be seen, to open doors, to find resources and thrive.</p>
         <p>Instead, I'm trying to hold being-in-practice and being-in-relation up at the front. They might not sparkle like achievements, but they are the foundation of everything.</p>
</p>

        <h2>What I did as Artist in Residence</h2>

        <p>I think about the work I did as a braid of practice, people, and products. Like a braid, these aren't separate items, they come from the same place and are inextricable from each other. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practice (forming context and work):</strong> being present, wandering with and without destination, illness, grappling with identity and body, failing and fumbling, tuning ideas, fiddling with materials, playing with tools (CNC Mill, laser cutter, fabrication, electronics, javascript),
            auditing classes (like Intro to Game Design with Eric Zimmerman or Joy and Games with Jane Friedhoff), visiting
            spaces & places (like Babycastles, La MaMa, libraries, EyeBeam, SFPC, ITP, parks, ferries). </li>
          <li><strong>People (community): </strong>Sharing space with people (faculty, students, people in the city). Connecting people and being connected. Navigating conflict, alienation, insecurity. Becoming attached in the slow way that
            requires proximity and time.</li>
          <li><strong>Products (things): </strong>Making a commissioned work for the No Quarter Exhibition ("Follow"). Creating joyful collaborative projects including "Arcade Friend" and "Tiny Dance Closet". Designing and performing
            "Emergency Exhibition Care". Working on a keycard project: make education accessible to all. Giving talks: an artist
            talk at
            the NYU Game Center, the first ever ITP/IMA Games Club, WWC NYC. Giving feedback on student work, guest teaching Intro to Game Design, a tiny workshop on stress, office hours, individual mentorship. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Being a resident</h2>

        <p>Being a resident is a gift. It's also a strange space to occupy. While being a resident, I thought and worked through what it meant to be a resident. I did intentional work around residency as an occupation. I spent time working through
          the marvelous positioning of being an outsider invited in. </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>The residency can be understood in three parts</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Part 1: Relocating to New York City. An intense 8-week hustle to design and code a brand new commissioned game for No Quarter. Navigating some major personal life changes.</li>
          <li>Part 2: Working on my NYU Game Center talk. Dealing with emergency housing instability. Recovering from Part 1.</li>
          <li>Part 3: A life-changing magical free time of collaboration, shaping work and thriving. The part I will delightedly carry with me for the rest of my life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning about formal games</h2>
        <p> I learned a lot about games. While studying the formal structure of traditional games I finally clarified some of the things I love about play, and also what I don’t like about games.</p>
        <p>For example: I am totally uninterested in using emotional manipulation to evoke intense scarcity-based fear and pushing players to embody stress-motivated competitive behaviours. This is no fun for me and I’m totally
          bewildered
          that this is fun for anyone.</p>

          <p>Sometimes I think this is just a matter of volume. Like I might like this as much as anyone, but the volume is just too loud. An interesting place for future exploration</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Connection: Relationships and community take time, and I didn't have time. I had to rally all my courage and be constantly vulnerable, inviting myself into people's busy lives.</li>
          <li>Time: I felt like each minute was full of possibility and the weather was always perfect and the work was always waiting and the time kept shrinking.</li>
          <li>Health: Some major health challenges including a muscle injury that got so bad I had to spend hours laying on the floor of my office with heat pads.</li>
          <li>Money: This was a well-paying job. But New York is expensive. And unexpected housing precarity in combination with health-related needs made the situation worse. Canada Council rejected the residency (no reason given).</li>
          <li>Housing/Safety: More than one incident. It was traumatic, expensive, and all-around awful. Thankfully P & T rescued me from the worst of it. </li>
          <li>Asking for help: I found it very challenging to even find the right person to ask for help (code, design, moving, everything!) let alone know what to ask or how to ask.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Regrets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I regret doing the No Quarter commission during the residency. I'm not sure where I would have found the time to do it sooner, but building a new game in 8 weeks is pretty hellish and consumed way too much time and energy.</li>
          <li>I wish I had started the following things sooner: office hours, sitting in on classes, inviting people to lunch. I didn't start until well after the No Quarter show (for obvious reasons) but they really helped with connection, community, and finding my place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If I were staying longer...?</h2>
        <p>For me this is the most interesting question. These are the thing that moved me the most, these are the parts I felt were still unfolding as my Visa ended and I had to leave.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Little experiments and playful interventions: these were absolutely the best part for me. When I was making these experiments I felt I was embodying what an artist-in-residence <em>could</em> be.</li>
          <li>Skill Sharing: For example, I noticed that interpersonal relations and people asserting needs clearly and early (and listening to the needs of others) was a desperately needed skill for many people. I did individual mentoring, but I
            would have liked to formally share my learned abilities around these skills. </li>
          <li>More collaborations: my favourite experiments and interventions were collaborative. When I was working with people (faculty, staff, students, outside community) on weird little projects I felt like we were building these live wires
            between us, creating the work and the context for the work all at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>When I was leaving I called a little meeting to review the experience. It was an in-person presentation of the content above. Below are few comments from people who attended. Everyone agreed that the talk should have been earlier in the
          residency. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>N: I loved the questions you sent before the residency. You sent these questions to us asking “what would a successful residency look like?” and these other questions about what we value and need and it shaped the conversation and the
            entire experience in a new way.</li>

          <li>D: Everyone here knew of you and about you because of these little special things you did. I loved the interventions for the showcase, Arcade Friend, the Dance Closet,
            the workshops you hosted. The big things were great too, but it was the little things that were most special for me.</li>
          <li>D: You are a model artist in residence. I loved when you came to speak at survival skills, and I LOVED your talk. It would make sense to do the talk earlier, now everyone wants to talk to you even more but you are leaving.</li>
          <li>C: This residency needs to be longer!</li>
          <li>F: You were an ideal artist in residence. I understand what artists in residence can do now in a way I didn’t get before. You have raised the bar on what we are able to imagine. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Thanks</h2>
